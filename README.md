# bb4-expression

This library project for parsing mathematical expressions.

To use, include this dependency in your gradle file

`compile 'com.barrybecker4:bb4-expression:<version>`

### [How to Build](https://github.com/barrybecker4/bb4-common/wiki/Building-bb4-Projects)
If you have not already done so, first install [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Intellij](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
You also need to have [java SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) installed and set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the location where it is installed.

Type 'gradlew build' at the root (prepend with ./ if running on Cygwin or Linux). This will build everything, but since it is a library project there won't be much to see. 

When there is a new release, versioned artifacts will be published by Barry Becker to [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org).
